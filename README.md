# Super-Snake

This is my version of a common project we had at the Target Innovations incubator where I learned JavaScript, HTML and many others. We thought it would be a great and fun way to put our knowledge and logic into practice through game development.

## How to Play

The game is super simple. The goal is to get the maximum score by making the snake eat the apple.
However, beware ... although easy, this game has its rules. You have a total of 3 lives. Whenever there is a collision between the snake and one of the edges of the play area, and / or a collision between the snake and itself you lose a life. 

This game can only be played on a computer. Use the keys: up, down, right and left to give direction to the snake. 
The keys (W, A, S, D) can also be used. W to go up, S to go down, A for left and D for right.
